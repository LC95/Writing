A sweaty toothed mad man with a stare that pounds my brain.  
His hands reach out and choke me, and all the time he's mumbling.  
“Truth, truth.”  
Like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.  
You push it, stretch it, but it'll never be enough.  
You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us.  
From the moment we enter crying,  
to the moment we leave dying,  
it'll just cover your face,  
as you wail and cry and scream.
